# General Questions

* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
Isomorphic Javascript: Javascript app that can run both on the client-side and the server-side. Serving fully-formed HTML from the server for performance and SEO, but with the speed and flexibility of client-side application logic.
* What excites or interests you about coding?
The ability to create and engineer solutions to a wide range of problems is enjoyable. I'm interested how by using simple abstractions, you can combine them to architect something complex and far reaching. These solutions provided by coding reach all domains of our lives.
* What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
By having a separation of server-side (Rails) views and client-side (React) views, refreshing and backspacing wouldn't work as intended. There were multiple solutions to problems range from using HashHistory/BrowserHistory, Catch-all, and Isomorphic Javascript. A history knows how to listen to the browser's address bar for changes and parses the URL into a location object that the router can use to match routes and render the correct set of components.
* What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?
Use a CSS framework for a quick demo UI, OmniAuth or Auth0 for client-side authentication/authorization, https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules?csw=1#speed-rules, use isomorphic javascript for SEO, proper documentation and source control.
* Talk about your preferred development environment.
OSX or Ubuntu. Atom or Sublime as an editor. iTerm2 instead of terminal for command line. vim/vi instead of emacs.
* Which version control systems are you familiar with?
Git
* Can you describe your workflow when you create a web app?
Use a pre-existing boilerplate/starter if at hand to structure the directory and handle module dependencies otherwise do it manually. Create an entry point for the bundler. Start prototyping the UI/Creating the resources/Serving the API/.
* If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?
Minify and clean CSS.
* Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
Progressive enhancement is the process of creating a base website and improving from there. Graceful degradation is creating the product with numerous features and stripping away features.
* How would you optimize a website's assets/resources?
* How many resources will a browser download from a given domain at a time?
* Name 3 ways to decrease page load (perceived or actual load time).
* If you jumped on a project and they used tabs and you used spaces, what would you do?
* Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page.
* If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?
